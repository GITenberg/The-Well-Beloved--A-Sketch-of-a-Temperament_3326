description: "The Well-Beloved: A Sketch of a Temperament is a novel by Thomas Hardy,\
  \ serialized in 1892, and published as a book in 1897.\nThe main setting of the\
  \ novel, the Isle of Slingers, is based on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, southern\
  \ England.\nMany of Hardy's novels were set in Dorset. The Well Beloved is one of\
  \ Hardy's last novels. It was first published in three-part serial form in 1892,\
  \ and then revised and re-published as a book in 1897, after Hardy's last novel\
  \ Jude the Obscure (1895). The novel tells the story of the sculptor Jocelyn Pierston's\
  \ search for the ideal woman, through three generations of a Portland family.\n\
  A cottage housing what is now part of Portland Museum, on the Isle of Portland,\
  \ founded by Marie Stopes, a friend of Hardy and his wife, was an inspiration for\
  \ the book. The cottage acted as the home of Avice, the novel's heroine.\n From\
